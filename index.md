## MY PHILOSOPHY
I believe the future of Autonomous systems will be a strong combination of Data Science, Deep Learning, and sophisticated Data Engineering. These will be the critical skills one will have to aquire if they want to shape the world in the next decade.

## DATA SCIENCE
### Python

## MACHINE LEARNING
This field is worth exploring especially now when we have so much data which we need to explore and make sense of.
